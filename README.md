# HR Data Analysis

Project Description
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of an HR dataset, primarily focused on understanding key workforce metrics. The project's goal is to uncover insights related to employee attrition, salary trends, and other critical human resources data points to inform strategic decision-making.
The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, leveraging various features to generate the reports and statistical summaries included here.
